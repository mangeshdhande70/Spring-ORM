Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.

In the navigation pane on the left-hand side, click on the "Schema" tab.

In the "Schema" tab, you should see a list of databases on your MySQL server. Click on the database you want to select.

If you don't see the database you want to select, you can create a new one by clicking the "Create New Schema" button at the top of the "Schema" tab.

Once you've selected a database, you can start working with the tables and data in that database. You can view the tables in the database by expanding the database in the "Schema" tab, or by clicking on the "Tables" tab in the main window.

Note that when you select a database in MySQL Workbench, any SQL statements you execute or changes you make will apply to that database. If you want to switch to a different database, simply repeat the steps above and select the database you want to work with.
